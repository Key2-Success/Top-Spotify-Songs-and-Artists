# Top Spotify Songs and Artists
The aim of this project is to explore the top 3 streamed songs and the top 3 streamed artists on Spotify from January 2017 to August 2017 among various countries to discover insights. Some questions I hope to answer are: do the top streamed songs correlate to the top streamed artists? How does region affect music taste? What kind of music is universally popular?

This is my first project done in Python, and I had a lot of fun working on this project because of how relevant and exciting the data is to me. I used plotly to make my bar plots, because they can be made interactive and are much more engaging than Python's visualizations.

## Content
I have included an .md of my project because Jupyter notebook does not yet render plotly graphs. In the .md, you will need to open the links to access my bar plots. My raw python code is also included.
