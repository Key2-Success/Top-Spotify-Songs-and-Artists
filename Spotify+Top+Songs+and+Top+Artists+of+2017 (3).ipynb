    "I really like this barplot, for many reasons. I appreciate that it's interactive, so that when you hover over a stacked bar, you can see the country, the song name, and the proportion it was streamed in that country. Another cool feature of this graph is that in the legend, you can disable and re-enable song names, if you would like to only compare select songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to actually analyze our findings: wow! This is pretty neat, actually. Across all the countries chosen and across the globe, Shape of You was a genuine hit! This truly cements the saying that music brings people together globally, regardless of language. I am especially pleased to see this finding because I had included Mexico and Taiwan, whose national language is not English, as well as Singapore, which is a cultural hub.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides Shape of You, Despacito also took off across many countries. Interestingly, the version that was most popular in Mexico was the one featuring Daddy Yankee - perhaps because he is of Hispanic origin. \n",
    "\n",
    "Something Just Like This was a popular streaming choice in both Taiwan and Singapore, which leads me to contemplate whether neighboring share similar song tastes, since these two countries are Asian.\n",
    "\n",
    "After these three songs, however, the remaining songs are specific to each country. As an American, I can definitely attest to the popularity of HUMBLE. and Mask Off. Whereas the other countries' top 3 songs are English (besides Despacito), Mexico and Taiwan both share a top song from their language, which is quite sweet, since it shows how different cultures and languages have their own unique sense of music, reminding me again of the importance of diversity - without it, others would not be able to engage and immerse in the beauty of others' cultures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Besides simply looking at the top songs, looking at each song's proportion is also fascinating. Singapore very much enjoyed Shape of You, above the global proportion, whereas the top 3 song streamed in the USA have relatively small proportions, leading me to believe that the USA has many popular song streams, each of which most likely share a lower proportion of streaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "These songs, in general, fall under the categories pop, rap, or hip-hop. These genres seem to be universally streamed.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, I realize that release date has a huge role to play in stream count, and a quick Google search showed that 9 of these songs were released no later than April 2017. Shape of You was released in the first week of January itself, so to be a \"popularly streamed\" song for a year, one must release the song earlier in the year. In the future, I would be curious to explore stream count for up until a month after the song release date, to normalize the difference in release date.\n",
    "\n",
    "I am very intrigued by these findings, and I would be interested in further exploring this data by looking into other countries or into more than just the top 3 songs. Unfortunately, I was limited by 6 countries and 3 top songs for the sake of simplicity in my barplot visualization - any more, and it would look too cluttered (originally, I had also included France, but it corrupted the simplicity of the barplot). Perhaps I will look into other types of visualizations, such as the donut plot or global map, or look into creating more than just 1 visualization. In the time being, however, I am going to listen to 演員 and Me Rehúso for the first time, as introduced to me by Taiwan and Mexico, respectively."

    "Besides the cool aspects of plotly, let's dive into analyzing what we see. Ed Sheeran is sure a hit across all these countries! And this makes sense, since Shape of You was also the most streamed song. It's especially captivating to see how Ed Sheeran's highest stream proportion is in Great Britain, his homeland country, by nearly twice as much as the global proportion. Seeing this makes me believe that a country is quite loyal to its citizens, since an artist is most likely most appreciated and listened to in his or her own country. How comforting to hear.\n",

    "Besides Ed Sheeran, The Chainsmokers also made quite a ripple across the globe, besides in Mexico and USA. Interestingly, both Taiwan and Singapore listen to The Chainsmokers at the highest proportion, which again solidifies my belief that countries in similar regions listen to similar music. This also makes sense because Something Just Like This was a top song choice for both of these two countries.\n",

    "I was initially curious to see how top songs compared to the top artists, so here is some insight: although Despacito was a success, Luis Fonsi did not make any country's top 3 artists list. Mask Off was also popular in the USA, but Future was not. These findings show that a top song may be popular in a country, but its artist might not be, or at least not to the song's extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, from these 8 artists, all 8 are male. I am a bit sad to see this, but it's no news that women aren't appreciated as much as men in most industries, music not being an exception to this tale. I am surprised not to see artists like Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, and Nicki Minaj, because the top songs fall in these artists' specialty: rap, hip-hop, and pop. Hopefully users can bridge the gap between male and female artists after being aware of such a disparity."
